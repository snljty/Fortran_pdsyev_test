# A simple example program using pdsyev subroutine in ScaLAPACK with Fortran 90.

1. If you want to compile with `GNU compilers`, Netlib `ScaLAPACK` + `LAPACK` + `BLAS` and `Open MPI`, load these environments and run:
```bash
./runtest.gnu.sh
```
.

2. If you want to compile with `Intel OneAPI compilers`, `Intel OneAPI MKL` and `Intel OneAPI MPI`, load these environments and run:
```bash
./runtest.intel.sh
```
.
